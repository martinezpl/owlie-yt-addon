Owlie is a browser extension that generates video summaries and descriptive works in general, e.g. comments, counter-arguments, poetry etc.

## How to install

### Firefox

1. Clone this repo
2. In the browser go to this address: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on...`
4. Select `manifest.json` in the repo's directory

## How to use

When visiting any Youtube video, you should see the extension's icon in the bottom panel of the video player. Click it to send the summary request. If a summary is generated, clicking it again hides the overlay (use it to re-adjust the overlay after changing the proportions of the video player).

Once summary is generated, you can send interactive requests by inserting text in the interactive field and clicking enter.

Click the little button in the bottom left to resend summary request.

## Known issues, things to improve

### GPT3's context limit of 4097 tokens

This limit makes it impossible to summarize videos that contain more than ~3000 words (from my observations, videos longer than ~15-20 minutes).

A workaround I have in mind is splitting the transcript, generating multiple summaries from the splits and then summarising the summaries at the end.

### Multilingual support

Currently Owlie fetches only English subtitles. It could look for other available subtitles, however if these are automatically generated by Youtube + the fact that GPT3 falls off in non-english languages, it'd probably produce rather miserable results. Worth a try though.

### UI can be better

- the displayed text could be more readable
- the overlay windows could be reactive to the video player's changes 
- doesn't seem obvious to me which tab is the active one :P
- loading indicators inside the overlay? 
- a general revamp with a neat, "populistic" design?

I'm happy to hear any suggestions.

### General code clarity

This is my first full project using html/css/js stack, I don't know any standards (just using linter) and the just code seems messy. Definitely needs a refactor, I'm happy to hear suggestions or see PRs :)

### Bugs
- occasionally components are positioned in places they're not supposed to
