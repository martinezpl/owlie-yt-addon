Owlie is a browser extension that generates video summaries and descriptive works in general, e.g. comments, counter-arguments, poetry etc.

## Local development

1. npm install --global web-ext
2. cd firefox / cd chromium
3. web-ext run --target chromium / firefox-desktop

This will open a browser window with the plugin loaded and any changes will be dynamically reloaded.

## How to use

Clicking Owlie's icon in the bottom right corner will trigger summarization. Once ready, chat will appear where you can ask further questions about the content of the video.

## Known issues, things to improve

### GPT3's context limit of 4097 tokens

This limit makes it impossible to summarize videos that contain more than ~3000 words (from my observations, videos longer than ~15-20 minutes).

A workaround I have in mind is splitting the transcript, generating multiple summaries from the splits and then summarising the summaries at the end.

### Multilingual support

Currently Owlie fetches only English subtitles. It could look for other available subtitles, however if these are automatically generated by Youtube + the fact that GPT3 falls off in non-english languages, it'd probably produce rather miserable results. Worth a try though.
